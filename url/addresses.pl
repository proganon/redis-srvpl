%!  url_address(+URL, ?Protocol, -HostPort) is semidet.
%
%   HostPort for Protocol at URL. The URL must contain a Port number,
%   otherwise fails. For example:
%
%       ?- url_address('tcp://localhost:1234', A, B:C).
%       A = tcp,
%       B = localhost,
%       C = 1234.
%
%   @arg URL is the text to parse as an URL.
%
%   @arg Protocol unifies with the URL's protocol.
%
%   @arg HostPort is a colon-functor compound comprising a Host atom and
%   Port integer.

url_address(URL, Protocol, Host:Port) :-
    parse_url(URL, Attributes),
    memberchk(protocol(Protocol), Attributes),
    memberchk(host(Host), Attributes),
    memberchk(port(Port), Attributes).
